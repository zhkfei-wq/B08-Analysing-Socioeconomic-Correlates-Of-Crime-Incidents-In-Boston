# Crime and Socioeconomic Inequality in Boston

A data-driven analysis investigating the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and crime patterns across Boston's police districts.

## Project Overview

This analysis investigates how socioeconomic inequality influences crime patterns across Boston's police districts. By integrating Boston Police Department crime incident data with socioeconomic indicators from the American Community Survey (ACS), the study examines correlations between income, poverty, and crime levels over both spatial and temporal dimensions.

## Objectives

- Examine correlations between economic disparity and crime concentration
- Identify spatial and temporal patterns in crime distribution
- Provide data-driven insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and community organizations
- Guide targeted intervention strategies for public safety

## Key Findings

### Income and Poverty Correlation
- Low-income and high-poverty districts (notably B2, D4, and C11) account for a disproportionately large share of total crimes
- Poverty shows positive correlation with crime rates
- Higher household income correlates with lower crime rates

### Crime Type Differentiation
- Property and administrative offenses dominate citywide
- Violent crimes are more prevalent in low-income areas
- High-income communities report fewer serious crimes

### Spatial and Temporal Patterns
- Crime hotspots cluster in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods (Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan)
- Crime peaks during summer months and nighttime hours
- Distinct variations between residential and commercial zones

### Income Disparity Impact
- Districts with highest poverty/unemployment rates have nearly double the crime rates of wealthier areas
- Poorer socioeconomic conditions correlate with higher exposure to violent and property crimes

### Longitudinal Stability (2020-2022)
- Relationship between socioeconomic status and crime remained structurally stable
- High-poverty communities consistently experienced the highest crime burdens

## Strategic Recommendations

### Targeted Community Investment
- Increase funding for education, youth employment, and social welfare programs in high-poverty, high-crime districts

### Data-Driven Policing
- Deploy predictive and geographically focused policing in persistent crime hotspots
- Align resource allocation with both crime volume and community needs

### Integrated Policy Response
- Combine law enforcement with housing, public health, and economic development initiatives
- Mitigate underlying socioeconomic triggers of crime

### Continuous Monitoring
- Establish longitudinal data platform linking socioeconomic indicators with crime metrics
- Track progress and refine intervention strategies annually
